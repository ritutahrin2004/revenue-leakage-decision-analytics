# Baseline Findings

This document summarizes baseline performance metrics used to understand the current operating state prior to any intervention.

These findings provide context for the prioritization decision documented in `decision_memo.md`.

## Baseline Revenue Performance

**Source:** `v_baseline_weekly_revenue`

Observations:
- Weekly net revenue is consistently non-trivial, indicating meaningful business scale
- Revenue fluctuates week to week, suggesting sensitivity to execution quality
- No prolonged revenue collapse is observed, implying demand exists and is being partially fulfilled

Implication:
- Revenue leakage is likely driven by **execution failures**, not lack of demand

---

## Baseline Delivery Performance

**Source:** `v_baseline_weekly_delivery`

Observations:
- Late delivery rates range roughly from **45% to 75%** across weeks
- Average delay appears moderate, but **p95 delay consistently exceeds acceptable thresholds**
- Performance indicates a long-tail reliability problem rather than isolated incidents

Implication:
- Mean-based metrics understate operational risk
- Customer experience is primarily driven by tail delays, not averages

## Baseline Customer Feedback

**Source:** `v_baseline_weekly_feedback`

Observations:
- Average ratings cluster around **3.3–3.5**
- Negative sentiment consistently ranges between **~25%–35%**
- Feedback volume is stable, indicating reliable signal rather than sampling noise

Implication:
- Customers are tolerating service issues but are not satisfied
- There is limited buffer for further service degradation

---

## Summary

Baseline metrics indicate:
- Healthy underlying demand
- Systematic operational reliability issues
- Customer sentiment already under pressure

These conditions support prioritizing execution improvements before demand-side optimization.
