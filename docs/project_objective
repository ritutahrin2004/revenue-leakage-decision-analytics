# Project Objective & Scope

## Project Overview

This project is a **decision-focused analytics case study** built on an online grocery business context.

The goal is not to showcase tools or models, but to demonstrate how integrated transactional, operational, inventory, and marketing data can be used to support **clear business prioritization under constraints**.

The project is designed to mirror how analytics is used in real organizations:  
to identify problems, quantify impact, evaluate trade-offs, and recommend what to fix first.

---

## Core Decision

**Which operational failure is causing the largest *preventable* net revenue loss, and therefore should be prioritized first?**

Specifically, the project evaluates three competing sources of revenue leakage:

1. **Inventory stockouts**  
2. **Delivery and fulfillment failures**  
3. **Marketing inefficiency**

The output of the project is a defensible recommendation on which area to address first, based on impact, risk, and feasibility.

---

## Time Horizon

The analysis focuses on a **short-term planning horizon (~8 weeks)**.

This horizon is intentionally chosen to:
- Reflect realistic operational decision cycles
- Capture near-term revenue impact
- Avoid speculative long-term assumptions

---

## Primary Metric

**Net Revenue**

All scenarios and trade-offs are evaluated relative to their effect on net revenue, not isolated operational metrics.

---

## Trade-offs & Guardrails

The decision is evaluated under explicit constraints:

### Trade-offs
- **Inventory risk:** stockout frequency and lost sales exposure  
- **Operational risk:** order errors, delivery delays, and customer complaints  

### Guardrail
- **Service risk:** the 95th percentile delivery delay must remain within an acceptable threshold derived from historical performance

These constraints prevent recommendations that improve revenue at the expense of customer experience or operational stability.

## What This Project Is (and Is Not)

### This project **is**:
- Decision-oriented rather than model-oriented
- Grounded in real-world data quality issues
- Explicit about assumptions and limitations
- Focused on prioritization, not perfection

### This project **is not**:
- A forecasting accuracy competition
- A machine learning showcase
- A dashboard-only project
- An academic exercise

## Project Structure

The project is organized into clear analytical layers:

1. **Raw ingestion**  
   Raw source data ingested without modification

2. **Staging layer**  
   Typed, validated, and well-grained datasets prepared in SQL

3. **Baseline metrics**  
   Descriptive analysis to establish current performance

4. **Revenue leakage decomposition**  
   Quantification of preventable revenue loss across competing failure modes

5. **Scenario evaluation**  
   Comparison of inventory-first, operations-first, and marketing-first strategies

6. **Recommendation**  
   A clear, constrained decision supported by evidence and risk analysis

## Explicitly Out of Scope

To maintain focus and realism, the following are intentionally excluded:

- Long-term customer lifetime value modeling  
- Individual-level personalization or targeting  
- Price optimization  
- Store expansion or geographic growth decisions  

---

## Current Status

- Project framing finalized  
- Raw data ingested  
- Staging layer completed  
- Ready to proceed with baseline metrics and revenue leakage analysis  

---

## Next Steps

1. Publish baseline revenue, delivery reliability, and customer pain metrics  
2. Quantify revenue leakage for each failure mode  
3. Evaluate scenarios under defined trade-offs and guardrails  
4. Produce a final recommendation and decision memo
