# Decision Memo: Revenue Leakage Prioritization

## Decision

Prioritize **delivery and fulfillment operations** as the first area of intervention to reduce preventable net revenue loss.

Inventory improvements should follow as a secondary initiative. Marketing optimization should be deferred until operational reliability improves.

---

## Evidence Summary

Weekly analysis shows a clear and persistent gap between operational leakage and inventory risk exposure.

### Operations (Delivery / Fulfillment)
- **45%–77% of weekly revenue** is associated with late deliveries
- Late orders consistently account for the majority of revenue volume
- High p95 delays indicate a long-tail reliability problem rather than isolated incidents

### Inventory
- **Average revenue exposure:** ~12%
- **Maximum observed exposure:** ~25%
- Several weeks show minimal or zero inventory risk

### Comparison
Even in weeks with elevated inventory risk, operational leakage remains **2–3× larger** in magnitude.

## Trade-offs & Guardrails

### Primary Metric
- **Net Revenue**

### Trade-offs
- Operational fixes may require capacity or cost increases
- Inventory improvements compete for capital and planning effort

### Guardrail
- **Service quality constraint:**  
  Interventions must not increase the 95th percentile delivery delay beyond current tolerance thresholds, as customer sentiment degrades in the tail.

## Recommendation

Adopt an **operations-first strategy** focused on:
- Reducing long-tail delivery delays
- Improving fulfillment reliability
- Stabilizing order execution consistency

Inventory initiatives should target high-risk SKUs identified through replenishment volatility but should not delay operational fixes.

Marketing efficiency optimization should be addressed only after operational reliability improves, as current leakage is dominated by execution failures rather than demand generation inefficiency.

## Next Steps (Next 2–4 Weeks)

1. Identify root causes of long delivery delays (routing, partner capacity, batching)
2. Set explicit p95 delay targets and monitor weekly
3. Track post-intervention revenue share from late orders
4. Begin targeted inventory stabilization for consistently stressed products

---

## Limitations

- Inventory risk is estimated using supply-side proxies due to lack of stock-on-hand data
- Results represent **revenue exposure**, not guaranteed lost sales

These limitations do not affect the prioritization outcome due to the magnitude gap observed.
